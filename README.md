# INIT TYPESCRIPT

## initial research
I began with looking over the documentation for Typescript at https://www.typescriptlang.org, 
from here I started working with the high level concepts of Typescript via https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript.
My next step was finding a cheap TS course on Udemy.com and beginning to watch a lecture series that covered the structure of typescript syntax and began to work from 
here to practice basic addition and logging data in the console. My objective over the weekend was to try and sort out the differences between JS and TS.

## Action Plan
The action plan for me continuing forward will be to next -
- Take a deep dive into the tsc compiler config
- Learn more about TS classes and interfaces
- Learn and practice Generics
- Learn and practice Decorators
- Read documentation to learn how to integrate TS with react and start and refactor and old repo to use TS instead of JS
